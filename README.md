# StockPricePrediction

Predicting stock prices is a challenging task as it depends on various factors including but not limited to geopolitics, global economy, companyâ€™s
financial reports and performance, etc. There are two main approaches to predicting the stock price: Technical analysis method uses metrics like 
closing and opening price, the volume traded, adjacent close values etc. of the stock for prediction, whereas qualitative analysis looks at external 
factors like company profile, market situation, political and economic factors, textual information in news, social media and even blogs by the 
economic analyst.
